//! Windows: shared Direct3D 12 resources as textures, ordered after the producer's fence.
//!
//! Media Foundation and the Direct3D video APIs decode into textures on their own device. A
//! producer shares a decoded `NV12` or `P010` texture as an NT handle, signals a shared fence when
//! the frame is written, and hands both handles over. The resource is opened on wgpu's Direct3D 12
//! device and reaches wgpu through its hal as one multi-planar texture. wgpu's queue waits on the
//! fence on the GPU, so no submission after the import reads the frame before the producer's
//! writes finish, and no thread waits on the processor.
