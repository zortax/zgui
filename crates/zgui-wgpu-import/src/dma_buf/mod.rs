//! Linux: dma-bufs as one multi-planar Vulkan image over the same memory.
//!
//! VA-API, V4L2 and GStreamer hand decoded frames out as dma-bufs: one or two file descriptors,
//! the offset and row stride of each plane, and the DRM format modifier that names how the memory
//! is tiled. The frame becomes one `NV12` or `P010` Vulkan image, created with exactly that
//! modifier and those plane layouts, bound to memory imported from the descriptors. Only the
//! finished image reaches wgpu, through its hal, and wgpu destroys it through the callback this
//! module gives it.
//!
//! # What has to hold
//!
//! * **The device extensions.** A modifier image needs `VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier`, which
//!   wgpu does not enable on its own. A program that imports dma-bufs opens its device with
//!   [`EXTENSIONS`]; the umbrella crate's `App::with_vulkan_extensions` is where they go.
//! * **The decoder's writes.** The importer waits on each descriptor until every write the kernel
//!   knows about has finished, so the image never shows a frame half decoded.
//! * **Plane views.** The image is mutable and lists its two single-plane formats, which is what
//!   lets the conversion pass view each plane on its own, as wgpu's own multi-planar images do.
//! * **No compression metadata.** wgpu adopts an image as uninitialised and its first barrier
//!   leaves `UNDEFINED`. Plain and tiled memory keeps its samples through that, but a modifier
//!   with compression metadata (AMD DCC, Intel CCS) may have the metadata reset. Such a modifier
//!   has more memory planes than the format has planes, and the importer refuses it as
//!   [`ImportError::Format`]; the producer then asks its decoder for an uncompressed surface or
//!   falls back to a copy.
//! * **Ownership.** A cached image is read again for every frame the decoder writes into its
//!   buffer, with no acquire from the foreign queue family between them; wgpu has no way to record
//!   one. Uncompressed modifiers need none in practice.
